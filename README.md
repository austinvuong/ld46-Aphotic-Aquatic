Congratulations on your internship with world renowned marine biology institute, Aphotic Aquatic! It's time to learn about an astounding array of deep sea fish and aquatic mammals at a state of the art institution. Or, it would be, if everyone's office fish didn't need babysitting.

Embark on a memory game wherein you try to remember how to take care of your coworkers' fish, featuring gameplay mechanics inspired by: [Indefinite: Interrogation - Memory, Story, Choices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.me.brandlibel.indefinite) by Brandon Li.
